    "Manual annotation is a process of marking documents with annotations that can be used to train or test a natural language processing system. We are using brat annotation tool to acquire annotations for your final project. \n",
    "Setting up a project within brat tool requires a set of files:\n",
    "- *.txt files - Text files to be annotated\n",
    "- *.ann files - Annotation files that will store annotations\n",
    "- annotation.conf: annotation type configuration\n",
    "- visual.conf: annotation display configuration\n",
    "- tools.conf: annotation tool configuration\n",
    "- kb_shortcuts.conf: keyboard shortcut tool configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Each annotation project typically defines its own annotation.conf. Defining visual.conf, tools.conf and kb_shortcuts.conf is not necessary, and the system falls back on simple default visuals, tools and shortcuts if these files are not present. \n",
