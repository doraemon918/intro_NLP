    "\n",
    "A clinical research team is planning a retrospective study of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) to evaluate comorbidities (i.e., medical conditions that can occur along with PAD) and risk factors associated with PAD. An analyst is recruited to help build a cohort of patients with the disease. The research team requested that there are a few important variables that are indicative of a PAD diagnosis: explicit mention of a PAD diagnosis in a clinical note and specific values of a test called the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) that are also recorded in notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task was to develop a system to identify positive mentions of PAD from each document in a set of clinical notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical context also has *temporality* and *experiencer* axes. However, peripheral arterial disease is a chronic condition that develops over time, therefore, it is never mentioned in hypotherical context (\\*\"if PAD develops...\"). It also never truly goes way, so if a patient had it befor, he/she still has the disease. Therefore, temporality axis always has value \"Current\". The disease also is never mentioned in relation to someone other than the patient, so the experiencer axis is always \"Patient\". Thus, the only context axis that matters is \"Negation\" with values of either  \"Affirmed\" or \"Negated\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output is a comma-delimited file that would have the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- patient identifier,\n",
    "- document identifier,\n",
    "- span starting index,\n",
    "- span ending index,\n",
    "- span snippet (the PAD mention string itself, e.g., \"peripheral artery disease\"),\n",
    "- affirmed/negated flag (e.g., an affirmative example: \"Mr. Jones has periperhal artery disease.\" so flag should indicate an affirmed mention; a negative example: \"Tests indicate no PAD present.\" so flag should indicate this is a false mention of PAD),\n",
