Understanding metabolic pathways is one of the most important fields in bioscience in the post-genomic era, but curating metabolic pathways requires considerable man-power. As such there is a lack of reliable, experimentally verified metabolic pathways in databases and databases are forced to predict all but the most immediately useful pathways.Text-mining has the potential to solve this problem, but while sophisticated text-mining methods have been developed to assist the curation of many types of biomedical networks, such as protein-protein interaction networks, the mining of metabolic pathways from the literature has been largely neglected by the text-mining community. In this chapter we describe a pipeline for the extraction of metabolic pathways built on freely available open-source components and a heuristic metabolic reaction extraction algorithm.
