This paper introduces the annotation schema and annotation process for a corpus of clinical letters describing the disease course and treatment of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients, after completion of primary surgery and radiotherapy treatment. Concepts related to therapy, clinical signs, and recurrence, as well as relationships linking these, are identified and annotated in 200 letters. This corpus will provide the basis for development of natural language processing tools for automatic extraction of key clinical factors from such letters.
