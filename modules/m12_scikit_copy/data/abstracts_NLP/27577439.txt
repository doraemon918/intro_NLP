This paper investigates how to extract probability statements from academic medical papers. In previous work we have explored traditional classification methods which led to numerous false negatives. This current work focuses on constraining classification output obtained from a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to allow for domain knowledge constraints. Our experimental results indicate constraining leads to a significant improvement in performance.
