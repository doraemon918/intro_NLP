Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the large homotetrameric protein complexes, regulate the release of calcium from intracellular stores into the cytosol and play vital roles in the excitation-contraction coupling of cells. However, the evolutionary relationship of RyRs in vertebrates has yet to be elucidated. We identified 22 RyRs from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Anolis carolinensis, Rana catesbeiana, and Danio rerio. The phylogenetic relationship, motifs analysis and reconstruction of ancestral RyRs showed that the members of RyR family in vertebrates were grouped into three clades: the RyR1 clade, the RyR2 clade, and the RyR3 clade. Positive selection existed in RyR gene evolution, which is consistent in three site models, and gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the evolution of RyR family in vertebrates promotes RyRs function differentiation. At last, we predicted 140 mutation sites which may be involved in diseases and 57 phosphorylation sites among RyR1 sequence in human, as well as 61 mutation sites and 70 phosphorylation sites in human RyR2 sequences. Most of these potential sites are arranged in clusters. Our work provides insight into the origin and evolutionary process of RyRs in vertebrates, facilitating their functional investigations in the future.
