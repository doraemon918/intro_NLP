PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based algorithm for objective classification of the optic disc in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG), using quantitative parameters obtained from ophthalmic examination instruments. METHODS: This study enrolled 163 eyes of 105 OAG patients (age: 62.3 +/- 12.6, mean deviation of Humphrey field analyzer: -8.9 +/- 7.5 dB). The eyes were classified into Nicolela's 4 optic disc types by 3 glaucoma specialists. Randomly, 114 eyes were selected for training data and 49 for test data. A neural network (NN) was trained with the training data and evaluated with the test data. We used 91 types of quantitative data, including 7 patient background characteristics, 48 quantified OCT (swept-source OCT; DRI OCT Atlantis, Topcon) values, including optic disc topography and circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT), and 36 blood flow parameters from laser speckle flowgraphy, to build the machine learning classification model. To extract the important features among 91 parameters, minimum redundancy maximum relevance and a genetic feature selection were used. RESULTS: The validated accuracy against test data for the NN was 87.8% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.83). The important features in the NN were horizontal disc angle, spherical equivalent, cup area, age, 6-sector superotemporal cpRNFLT, average cup depth, average nasal rim disc ratio, maximum cup depth, and superior-quadrant cpRNFLT. CONCLUSION: The proposed machine learning system has proved to be good identifiers for different disc types with high accuracy. Additionally, the calculated confidence levels reported here should be very helpful for OAG care.
