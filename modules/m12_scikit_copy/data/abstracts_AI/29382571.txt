Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common orthopedic disease associated with high disability, and femoral neck fracture (FNF) is one of the most common reasons for traumatic ONFH. This study was designed to reveal the mechanisms underlying ONFH. Using fastx_toolkit and prinseq-lite tools, quality control was conducted for the sequencing data. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs, including both mRNAs and lncRNAs) between ONFH and FNF samples were identified using the edgeR package in R, and were then subjected to enrichment analysis using the BioCloud platform. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape software. After the target genes of DE-lncRNAs were predicted based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, lncRNA-gene coexpression network was visualized using the Cytoscape software. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis was carried out for the target genes using the clusterprofiler package in R. Additionally, the key genes were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 2965 DEGs were identified from the ONFH samples, including 602 DE-lncRNAs (such as downregulated FAM201A). In the PPI networks, eight upregulated genes (including FGF2, IGF1, SOX9, and COL2A1) and 11 downregulated genes were among the top 20 genes according to all of the scores, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality scores. Functional enrichment analysis showed that IGF1, SOX9, and COL2A1 were significantly enriched during skeletal system development. Moreover, qRT-PCR experiments detected the upregulation of FGF2 and downregulation of FAM201A in ONFH samples. FGF2 and FAM201A were correlated with the development of ONFH. Besides, IGF1, SOX9, and COL2A1 might also affect the pathogenesis of ONFH.
