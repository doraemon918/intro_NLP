Topping is an important agronomic practice that significantly impacts the yield of various crop plants. Topping and the regulation of axillary shoot outgrowth are common agronomic practices in tobacco. However, the effects of topping on gene expression in tobacco remain unknown. We applied the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from untopped and topped plants to study the global changes in gene expression in response to topping. We found that the number of DEGs varied from 7609 to 18,770 based on the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) values. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that the cellular carbohydrate metabolic process and the disaccharide metabolic process, which may contribute to starch accumulation and stress/defense, were overrepresented terms for the DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that many DEGs were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction, among other processes. The knowledge gained will improve our understanding of the processes of axillary shoot formation and enlargement at the transcriptional level. This study lays a solid foundation for future studies on molecular mechanisms underlying the growth of axillary shoots.
