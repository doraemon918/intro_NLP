A nociceptor is a critical and special receptor of a sensory neuron that is able to detect noxious stimulus and provide a rapid warning to the central nervous system to start the motor response in the human body and humanoid robotics. It differs from other common sensory receptors with its key features and functions, including the "no adaptation" and "sensitization" phenomena. In this study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an artificial nociceptor based on a diffusive memristor with critical dynamics for the first time. Using this artificial nociceptor, we further built an artificial sensory alarm system to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and simplicity of integrating such novel artificial nociceptor devices in artificial intelligence systems, such as humanoid robots.
