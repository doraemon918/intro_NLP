Favism is an acute hemolytic syndrome caused by the ingestion of fava bean (FB) in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals. However, little is known about the global transcripts alteration in liver tissue after FB ingestion in G6PD-normal and -deficient states. In this study, deep sequencing was used to analyze liver genes expression alterations underlying the effects of FB in C3H (Wild Type, WT) and G6PD-deficient (G6PDx) mice and to evaluate and visualize the collective annotation of a list of genes to Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with favism. Our results showed that FB resulted in a decrease of glutathione (GSH)-to-oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) both in the G6PDx and WT-control check (CK) mice plasma. Significantly, liver transcript differences were observed between the control and FB-treated groups of both WT and G6PDx mice. A total of 320 differentially expressed transcripts were identified by comparison of G6PDx-CK with WT-CK and were associated with immune response and oxidation-reduction function. A total of 149 differentially expressed genes were identified by comparison of WT-FB with WT-CK. These genes were associated with immune response, steroid metabolic process, creatine kinase activity, and fatty acid metabolic process. A total of 438 differential genes were identified by comparing G6PDx-FB with G6PD-CK, associated with the negative regulation of fatty acid metabolic process, endoplasmic reticulum, iron binding, and glutathione transferase activity. These findings indicate that G6PD mutations may affect the functional categories such as immune response and oxidation-reduction.
