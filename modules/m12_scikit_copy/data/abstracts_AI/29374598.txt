Sagittaria sagittifolia L is an important bulb vegetable that has high nutritional and medical value. Bulb formation and development are crucial to Sagittaria sagittifolia; however, its sucrose metabolism is poorly understood and there are a lack of sufficient transcriptomic and genomic data available to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying bulb formation and development as well as the bulb transcriptome. Five cDNA libraries were constructed at different developmental stages and sequenced using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing. From approximately 63.53Gb clean reads, a total of 60,884 unigenes, with an average length of 897.34bp and N50 of 1.368kb, were obtained. A total of 36,590 unigenes were successfully annotated using five public databases. Across different developmental stages, 4195, 827, 832, 851, and 1494 were differentially expressed in T02, T03, T04, T05, and T06 libraries, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed several differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) associated with catalytic activity, binding, and transporter activity. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) revealed that these DEGs are involved in physiological and biochemical processes. RT-qPCR was used to profile the expression of these unigenes and revealed that the expression patterns of the DEGs were consistent with the transcriptome data. In this study, we conducted a comparative gene expression analysis at the transcriptional level using RNA-seq across the different developmental stages of Sagittaria sagittifolia. We identified a set of genes that might contribute to starch and sucrose metabolism, and the genetic mechanisms related to bulblet development were also explored. This study provides important data for future studies of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying bulb formation and development in Sagittaria sagittifolia.
