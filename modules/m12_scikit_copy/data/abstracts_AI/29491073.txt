AIM: To report on the unique, innovative management of a super morbidly obese patient presenting for fertility preservation in the setting of Grade 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. CASE REPORT: A back-to-back oocyte retrieval and robot-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy (RA-TLH) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was performed in a 37-year-old nulligravid woman with super morbid obesity (BMI 63 kg/m(2)) with endometrial cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: the successful retrieval of oocytes for fertility preservation and oncologic intervention via RA-TLH with BSO in the same operative and anesthetic episode. RESULTS: This combined procedure strategy was successful in our case and is a feasible option for similar high-risk patients in the future. CONCLUSION: Identifying safe and effective approaches for oocyte retrieval in morbidly obese patients represents a pressing need as obesity rates rise among reproductive-aged women. Back-to-back oocyte retrieval and RA-TLH with BSO are not only feasible, but could also decrease significant anesthetic risks for morbidly obese patients.
