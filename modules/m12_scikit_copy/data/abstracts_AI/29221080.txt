The computational power required to classify cell holograms is a major limit to the throughput of label-free cell sorting based on digital holographic microscopy. In this work, a simple integrated photonic stage comprising a collection of silica pillar scatterers is proposed as an effective nonlinear mixing interface between the light scattered by a cell and an image sensor. The light processing provided by the photonic stage allows for the use of a simple linear classifier implemented in the electric domain and applied on a limited number of pixels. A proof-of-concept of the presented machine learning technique, which is based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) paradigm, is provided by the classification results on samples generated by 2D FDTD simulations of cells in a microfluidic channel.
