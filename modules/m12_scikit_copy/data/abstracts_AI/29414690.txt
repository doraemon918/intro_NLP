Genetic and environmental factors such as high-fat diet are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Cynomolgus monkey shares similar genetic makeup, tissue structures, physiology and metabolic function to human. This study aimed to establish T2DM model in cynomolgus monkey and compare expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in normal cynomolgus monkeys and those with T2DM. We employed RNA-seq technique and identified 1451 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% between normal and T2DM animals. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were associated with 12 KEGG pathways (P<0.05). Two of these pathways were associated with metabolism and five were related to immunity. Unexpected, we found ECM-receptor interaction pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest that three major pathways may be implicated in the development of T2DM, including steroid biosynthesis, immune response and ECM. Further characterization of these pathways may provide new targets for the prevention and therapy of T2DM.
