This paper addresses the problem of quantifying biomarkers in multi-stained tissues based on the color and spatial information of microscopy images of the tissue. A deep learning-based method that can automatically localize and quantify the regions expressing biomarker(s) in any selected area on a whole slide image is proposed. The deep learning network, which we refer to as Whole Image (WI)-Net, is a fully convolutional network whose input is the true RGB color image of a tissue and output is a map showing the locations of each biomarker. The WI-Net relies on a different network, Nuclei (N)-Net, which is a convolutional neural network that classifies each nucleus separately according to the biomarker(s) it expresses. In this study, images of immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained slides were collected and used. Images of nuclei (4679 RGB images) were manually labeled based on the expressing biomarkers in each nucleus (as p16 positive, Ki-67 positive, p16 and Ki-67 positive, p16 and Ki-67 negative). The labeled nuclei images were used to train the N-Net (obtaining an accuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained N-Net was then extended to WI-Net that generated a map of all biomarkers in any selected sub-image of the whole slide image acquired by the scanner (instead of classifying every nucleus image). The results of our method compare well with the manual labeling by humans (average F-score of 0.96). In addition, we carried a layer-based immunohistochemical analysis of cervical epithelium, and showed that our method can be used by pathologists to differentiate between different grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by quantitatively assessing the percentage of proliferating cells in the different layers of HPV positive lesions.
