This paper mainly studies the globally fixed-time synchronization of a class of coupled neutral-type neural networks with mixed time-varying delays via discontinuous feedback controllers. Compared with the traditional neutral-type neural network model, the model in this paper is more general. A class of general discontinuous feedback controllers are designed. With the help of the definition of fixed-time synchronization, the upper right-hand derivative and a defined simple Lyapunov function, some easily verifiable and extensible synchronization criteria are derived to guarantee the fixed-time synchronization between the drive and response systems. Finally, two numerical simulations are given to verify the correctness of the results.
