Since absorption of X-ray radiation has the possibility of inducing cancerous, genetic and other diseases to patients, researches usually attempt to reduce the radiation dose. However, reduction of the radiation dose associated with CT scans will unavoidably increase the severity of noise and artifacts, which can seriously affect diagnostic confidence. Due to the outstanding performance of deep neural networks in image processing, in this paper, we proposed a Stacked Competitive Network (SCN) approach to noise reduction, which stacks several successive Competitive Blocks (CB). The carefully handcrafted design of the competitive blocks was inspired by the idea of multi-scale processing and improvement the network's capacity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method in noise suppression, structural preservation, and lesion detection.
