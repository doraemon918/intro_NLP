In pyConText, we set up a simple information model to represent the concepts we are looking for, which includes two components: targets and modifiers.\n",

    "\n",
    "pyConText is a python implementation of ConText algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "ConText determines the values for three contextual properties of a clinical condition: Negation, Temporality, and Experiencer. \n",
    "- The contextual property **Negation** specifies the status of the clinical existence of a condition. The default value of this property is ***affirmed***. If a clinical condition occurs within the scope of a trigger term for negation, ConText will change the default value to ***negated***. For example, in the sentence “The patient denies any nausea,” the value of Negation for the condition “nausea” will be negated.\n",
    "- The contextual property **Temporality** places a condition along a simple time line. The default value of Temporality is ***recent***. Given appropriate trigger terms, ConText can change the value of this property to either ***historical*** or ***hypothetical***. The value hypothetical covers all conditions that temporally are neither recent nor historical. A typical example of a hypothetical condition would be “fever” in a sentence such as “Patient should return if she develops fever.”\n",
    "- Finally, the contextual property **Experiencer** describes whether the patient or someone else experiences the condition. The default value is ***patient***, which, in the presence of a trigger term, can be changed to ***other***. For example, in the sentence “The patient's father has a history of CHF”, the value of Experiencer for the condition CHF is other. "
